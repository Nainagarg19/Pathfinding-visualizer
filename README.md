# Pathfinding Visualizer

The Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application that visually demonstrates the <strong>Dijkstra algorithm</strong> in action. It provides a dynamic and intuitive platform for users to understand the process of pathfinding in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Observe the Dijkstra algorithm as it iteratively explores the graph and discovers the shortest path.
- **Dynamic Barrier Creation:** Simulate obstacles and environments by interactively placing barriers on the grid.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface allows users to easily control and experiment with the visualization.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML:** Structure of the visualizer
- **CSS:** Styling and layout
- **JavaScript:** Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm and interactivity
